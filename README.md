# data-structures
Implementation (naive) of some data structures by myself using Javascript.

## Linked List: 

* length: Amount of items in the list.
* getList(): Gets all the elements in the linked list.
* getElement(value): Gets the positions of all elements that match value.
* insert(value, position): Inserts an element in a given position.
* delete(position): Deletes an element in a given position.
* deleteAll(): Deletes all element in the list.

## Queue: 

* length: Amount of items in the queue.
* pop(): Removes the first element added to the queue.
* getQueue(): Gets all elements in the queue.
* push(value): Pushes an element in the queue.

## Stack: 

* length: Amount of items in the stack.
* pop(): Removes the last element added to the stack.
* getStack(): Gets all elements in the stack.
* push(value): Pushes an element in the stack.
