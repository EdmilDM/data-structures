# data-structures
Implementation of some data structures by myself using Javascript.

## Linked List: 

* length: Amount of items in the list.
* getList(): Gets all the elements in the linked list.
* getElement(value): Gets the position of all elements that match value and their position.
* insert(value, position): Inserts an element in a given position.
* delete(position): Deletes an element in a given position.
* deleteAll(): Deletes all element in the list.
